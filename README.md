> Andrej Karpathy's [viral post](https://x.com/karpathy/status/1907477278835749189) on LLM Knowledge Bases hit 1.7M views. This is the definitive resource list for the workflow he described.

> **"raw data from a given number of sources is collected, then compiled by an LLM into a .md wiki, then operated on by various CLIs by the LLM to do Q&A and to incrementally enhance the wiki, and all of it viewable in Obsidian. You rarely ever write or edit the wiki manually, it's the domain of the LLM."**

## FAQ

### What is an LLM knowledge base?

An LLM knowledge base is a structured collection of markdown documents that are compiled, maintained, and queried using large language models. Instead of manually writing a wiki, you feed raw data to an LLM which organizes it into interlinked pages - then use CLI tools to ask questions and incrementally improve the content.

### How do I build a personal knowledge base with LLMs?

Start by ingesting your sources (web pages, PDFs, notes) into markdown using tools like [Docling](https://github.com/DS4SD/docling) or [Jina Reader](https://github.com/jina-ai/reader). Then use an LLM agent such as [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) or [Aider](https://github.com/Aider-AI/aider) to compile the fragments into a structured wiki. View and navigate the result in [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md).

### What's the best tool for converting PDFs to markdown?

[Marker](https://github.com/VikParuchuri/marker) is widely regarded as one of the best options - it handles complex layouts, tables, and equations with high accuracy. For vision-model-based extraction, [Zerox](https://github.com/getomni-ai/zerox) offers zero-shot OCR. [Docling](https://github.com/DS4SD/docling) from IBM is another strong choice, especially for mixed-format document pipelines.

### Can I use Obsidian with LLM knowledge bases?

Yes - Obsidian is the recommended viewer for this workflow. Its graph view, backlinks, and plugin ecosystem make it ideal for navigating LLM-generated wikis. Plugins like [Obsidian Copilot](https://github.com/logancyang/obsidian-copilot) and [Smart Connections](https://github.com/brianpetro/obsidian-smart-connections) add AI-powered chat and note discovery directly inside the app.

### What is the Karpathy knowledge base workflow?

Andrej Karpathy described a workflow where raw data from multiple sources is collected, compiled by an LLM into a `.md` wiki, then operated on by CLI tools for Q&A and incremental enhancement - all viewable in Obsidian. The key insight is that you rarely write or edit the wiki manually; that's the LLM's job. See the [original thread](https://x.com/karpathy/status/1907477278835749189).

### How do I query my knowledge base with AI?

Use a RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) framework like [LlamaIndex](https://github.com/run-llama/llama_index) or [LangChain](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain) to index your markdown files and ask natural language questions. For a simpler approach, tools like [Khoj](https://github.com/khoj-inc/khoj) and [Quivr](https://github.com/QuivrHQ/quivr) provide ready-to-use personal AI assistants that work directly with your documents.
